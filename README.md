## Tv Series Tracker

Goal: Practice OO and UI design what I learned in Java / Android 

### MVP
You are required to write an Android app that allows a user to track the Tv Shows they watch. 
Users should be able to enter what they watch. 

### Project Extension
The app should show the user a record of what they have watched over a given period e.g. In March I saw X and Y Tv shows.
